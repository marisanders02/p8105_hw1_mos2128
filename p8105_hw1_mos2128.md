``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

This document uses `tidyverse` and `palmerpenguins` packages.

# Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins") 
```

The Penguins dataset has 344 rows and 8 columns. This means there are
344 observations. The rows in this data set are named species, island,
bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex,
year. The mean flipper length is 200.9152047.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, 
  aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```

``` r

# Problem 2

``` r
sample_df <- tibble(
  norm = rnorm(10), 
  logic = norm > 0, 
  char = c("A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J"),
  fact = factor(c(2,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4), levels = c(2,3,4))
)
sample_df %>% 
  pull(var = norm) %>% 
  mean()
```

    ## [1] 0.07072305

``` r
sample_df %>% 
  pull(var = logic) %>% 
  mean()
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
sample_df %>% 
  pull(var = char) %>% 
  mean()
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(.): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
sample_df %>% 
  pull(var = fact) %>% 
  mean()
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(.): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

You can take the mean of an double type and a logical type, but not a
character or a factor.

``` r
sample_df %>% 
  pull(var = norm) %>% 
  as.numeric()

sample_df %>% 
  pull(var = logic) %>% 
  as.numeric()

sample_df %>% 
  pull(var = char) %>% 
  as.numeric()

sample_df %>%  
  pull(var = fact) %>% 
  as.numeric()
```

You are able to change the integers and logic values to numeric values,
but you cannot change characters or factors into numeric values, so this
means you are unable to take the mean of those two types.

Character vectors cannot be changed into numeric values because they are
stored as characters and do not have a number equivalent. When you use
`as.numeric` on a factor, it outputs the the factor that the value is
in, not the direct value.
